<p><a href="freeware/SideSwitch_setup.exe"><img src="freeware/ico_sideswitch.png" width="32" border="0" height="32" hspace="4" align="left" />SideSwitch</a> is not a TaskBar replacement*. It is an aid to help with application switching. The default TaskBar, on a multi-monitor environment, displays a button for each application on only one monitor, disregarding which monitor the window of the application is shown on. SideSwitch show a list of applications that are displayed on a monitor, when the mouse pointer hits one of the edges of that monitor. This shows a better overview than the taskbar, and still doesn't require you to press any keys (as opposed to Alt-Tab).	SideSwitch also allows you to switch windows between monitors, without having to restore, drag and maximize.</p>
