  SideSwitch
==============

Thank you for installing SideSwitch.
Move the mouse-cursor to an edge of the screen (but not a corner):
SideSwitch displays a list of the current windows on this monitor.
Click the window title to bring it to the front.
Click " _ " to minimize the window.
Click " x " to close the window.

Right-click any of the items to show the context-menu.
Tune the settings to your preference.
It's highly recommended to enable
  "Start when Windows starts"
(disabled by default).
