Thank you for installing SideSwitch!

SideSwitch shows a list of applications* when you move the cursor to the edge
of the screen, not the corners, but the center two quarters of the width or 
height.

Right-click to change settings or close SideSwitch.

*: on multi-monitor systems, shows applications that have the main window on
the current monitor.
