# Tools: Crypto

Not finding what I wanted when searching for open-source Delphi/Pascal implementations of crypto functions, under a permissive license or without copyright, I created my own and share them here.
**Important:** though the headers state "License: no license, free for any use" it also implies no warranties are made. No warranty of a fitness for a purpose or merchantability, and non-infringement and all. No liability for claims or damages with all your contracts and torts and otherwise arising connection dealings you know who you are. I expect I'm sufficiently covered by the laws of my home country (not the U.S.).
**Also:** in the spirit of [this warning (Act 3 second image)](http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html) I make no guarantees whatsoever about robustness against side-channel attacks or anything else for that matter.
